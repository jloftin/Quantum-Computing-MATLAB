# Quantum Computing with MATLAB

This repository serves as the home page for community members interested in quantum computing
with MATLAB&reg;. The goal is to provide examples, functions and otherwise helpful material using the [MATLAB 
Support Package for Quantum Computing](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/quantum-computing.html), available through the Add-On Explorer or File Exchange. 

## Required Products
- MATLAB&reg; Support Package for Quantum Computing (version 23.1.2)
- Connection to remote quantum devices and simulators requires additional setup. For more information go to:
  [Run Quantum Circuit on Hardware Using AWS](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/run-quantum-circuit-on-hardware.html)
  [Run Quantum Circuit on Hardware Using IBM](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/run-quantum-circuit-on-hardware-using-IBM.html)
- Examples may depend on other products which are listed in each respective README file.
